# Data Cleaning and Feature Correlation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic data cleaning and correlation analysis between features using the Iris dataset. The steps outlined showcase essential techniques in data preprocessing and analysis.

## File Structure
- `datacleaning.py`: Main Python script for data cleaning and calculating feature correlations.

## Environment Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pandas library
- Numpy library

## Setup and Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install required Python libraries with the following commands:


This script demonstrates:
1. How to load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.
2. Convert the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Check and drop rows with all missing values.
4. Select certain rows and columns.
5. (Optional) Compute correlation between features.

Instructions:
1. Make sure you have installed pandas and scikit-learn:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
2. Run the script:
   python demo.py
3. Observe the printed output in the console.

Enjoy exploring the Iris dataset!
